# MULTIC-TS-LBM

**MULTIC-TS-LBM** is a **GPU-accelerated**, thread-safe Lattice Boltzmann simulator for multicomponent flows. Implemented in CUDA, it supports **D3Q19/D3Q27** for hydrodynamics and **D3Q7** for phase-field evolution, capturing interface dynamics, surface tension, and perturbations. Available cases: **droplet** and **jet**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA (CC ‚â• 6.0, ‚â• 2 GB, 4+ GB recommended)  
- **CUDA**: Toolkit ‚â• 11.0  
- **Compiler**: C++ (`g++`, `nvcc`)  
- **Python 3.x**: `numpy`, `pyevtk`

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

- `bin/` ‚Äì compiled binaries & results  
- `helpers/` ‚Äì auxiliary CUDA headers/scripts  
- `include/` ‚Äì core LBM includes and functions
- `post/` ‚Äì Python post-processing to VTK  
- `src/` ‚Äì C/C++ and CUDA sources  
- `compile.sh` ‚Äì build script  
- `pipeline.sh` ‚Äì compile ‚Üí run ‚Üí post-process

## üöÄ Run

```bash
./pipeline.sh <velocity_set> <id>
```

* `velocity_set`: `D3Q19` | `D3Q27`
* `id`: simulation ID (e.g., `000`)

Pipeline: compile ‚Üí simulate ‚Üí post-process

## ‚ö° Benchmark

Performance is reported in **MLUPS** (Million Lattice Updates Per Second).  
Each GPU entry shows the average across multiple runs.

| GPU            | D3Q19 (MLUPS) | D3Q27 (MLUPS) |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| RTX 3050 (4GB) | **760**       | ‚Äì             |
| RTX 4090 (24GB)| ‚Äì             | ‚Äì             |
| A100 (40GB)    | ‚Äì             | ‚Äì             |

*Important considerations:*  
- **D3Q19** uses **He forcing (1st order)** and 2nd-order equilibrium/non-equilibrium expansion.  
- **D3Q27** uses **Guo forcing (2nd order)** and 3rd-order equilibrium/non-equilibrium expansion.  
- These methodological differences contribute to the observed performance gap, beyond the natural cost of upgrading from **19** to **27** velocity directions.

## üß† Project Context

This code was developed as part of an undergraduate research fellowship at the Geoenergia Lab (UDESC ‚Äì Balne√°rio Cambori√∫ Campus), under the project:

**"Experiment-based physical and numerical modeling of subsea oil jet dispersion (SUBJET)"**, in partnership with **Petrobras, ANP, FITEJ and SINTEF Ocean**.

## üìä Credits

The post-processing workflow is mostly shared with the project [MR-LBM](https://github.com/CERNN/MR-LBM).
The implementation is strongly based on the article *[A high-performance lattice Boltzmann model for multicomponent turbulent jet simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15773)*.
